# 🔮 AI Cursor — Your Always-On Screen Intelligence Layer

We added superpowers to your cursor.  
You can sleep — but your cursor won’t.

AI Cursor transforms your operating system’s pointer into a multimodal AI assistant that understands your screen, your voice, and your workflow.  
This is not a UI trick — it’s a new interaction model for the entire computer.

## ✨ Features

### 🖼️ VisionSnap Mode — The Extraction Engine  
Capture anything on your screen and extract meaning instantly.

- Drag-and-select regions  
- Click on images, graphs, UI elements  
- Extract text, numbers, tables, URLs  
- Auto-copy insights to clipboard  
- Powered by **Gemini Vision**

Perfect for students, researchers, developers, and teams working with visual data.

---

### ✍️ Clarify Mode — Real-Time Intelligence Layer  
Hover over any text on your screen and the cursor understands it instantly.

- Summaries  
- Rewrites  
- Spell-fixes  
- Explanations  
- Tone adjustments  

This transforms the cursor into a live editor, explainer, and language assistant powered by **Gemini Text**.

---

### 🎙️ Navigator Mode — Voice-Activated Copilot  
Hold the **spacebar** and ask questions about anything you point at.

- “Explain this graph.”  
- “What does this button do?”  
- “Rewrite this paragraph professionally.”  
- “Simplify this documentation.”  

AI Cursor listens, interprets your screen context, and provides meaningful responses through audio or text using **Gemini Audio**.

---

### 🎨 Dynamic Custom Cursors  
Each AI mode has its own animated cursor style:

- Hover  
- Processing  
- Listening  
- Active  
- Error  
- Success  

These custom animations make the cursor feel alive — delivering a futuristic, high-quality user experience.

---

### 🧠 Multimodal AI Integration  
The system uses **three different Gemini capabilities**, combined to understand anything you:

| Capability | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Vision** | Screen capture, OCR, UI understanding |
| **Text** | Summaries, rewrites, explanations |
| **Audio** | Voice commands, contextual responses |

The cursor doesn’t just move — it **sees, thinks, and responds**.

---

### 🌈 High-Fidelity User Interface  
Includes a premium landing page designed with:

- Glassmorphism  
- Micro-interactions  
- Smooth animations  
- Instrument Serif + Inter typography  
- A clean, modern SaaS layout  

Inspired by Apple-level design principles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note:** This is a system-level cursor engine.  
> It does **not** run inside a browser — it interacts directly with the operating system.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/ai-cursor
cd ai-cursor
```
```
pnpm install
```
```
pnpm dev
```
```
pnpm build
```

🔧 How It Works (Architecture Overview)
1. Capture Layer

Screenshots, UI regions, and selections → sent to VisionSnap for extraction.

2. Pointer Engine

A custom-built cursor layer replaces the OS cursor visually.

3. Overlay Layer

Transparent system overlay displays the AI cursor, hints, and responses.

4. AI Worker Layer

Handles:

Vision extraction

Summaries & rewrites

Voice queries

5. Mode Engine

Switches between:

VisionSnap

Clarify

Navigator

Depending on user input and screen context.

📌 Roadmap

Universal desktop app installer

Gesture recognition

Auto-actions (AI-driven clicks and workflows)

On-device AI model support

Developer plugin system

Marketplace for custom cursor themes

🏆 Why This Project Matters

This project introduces a new computing paradigm:

Instead of opening an app to use AI,
you simply point at what you want —
and your cursor understands it.

It elevates the most basic computer interaction — the cursor — into an intelligent assistant.
